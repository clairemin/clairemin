    <h4>
      — q&a
    </h4>

    <div>
      <em>when & why did you first start translating?</em>
    </div>

    <p>
      <div>
        I started translating back in February of 2018, purely just for fun. Growing up Korean, in America, I was still surrounded by Korean culture, but I’d never quite delved further than just skimming the surface.
      </div>
      <div>
        Becoming an ARMY, I scrolled through comments from thousands of ARMYs, including memes, millions of hearts, and quite a few “I don’t know exactly what you’re saying.. but I love you!!” tweets.
      </div>
      <div>
        It really warmed my heart to see that other ARMYs continued to pour-out their love and support, despite a seemingly clear language barrier.
      </div>
      <div>
        I just wanted to offer my shared enthusiasm in the community, and I found exactly what I enjoyed doing, through translating.
      </div>

    <p>
      <em>what is the most challenging part of being a fan translator?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div>
        If there was ever a challenge, I would have to admit that, as I’m only human, I do feel the occasional wave of responsibility that comes with managing such a large audience.
      </div>
      <div>
        But rather than seeming like a job that needs to be done because I have to do it, translating has continued to be fun and enjoyable way for me to become a part of the family that is ARMY.
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>have you ever received payment for your work?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div>
        As far as I know, nearly every ARMY translator out there, including myself, voluntarily translates… just for the sake of sharing their enthusiasm and support for BTS with other ARMYs. Rather than receiving payment, we translate solely because we choose to, and because it is just such a great way to connect with other ARMYs through our support of the group.
      </div>
      <div>
        Being able to play a part in bringing BTS and ARMYs even a little closer together is rewarding in and of itself, and connecting with ARMYs internationally, from all walks of life, is incentive enough to continue to dedicate and invest time into.
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>what is the most powerful thing about BTS?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div>
        The expression “music transcends barriers” is perfect for everything BTS stands for. Through music, through communication with their fans, it’s powerful how BTS can encourage self-love, hope, and inspiration, giving confidence to people to pursue and hold onto their dreams and aspirations.
      </div>
        Since their debut, and to this day, they stay as humble as before, are sincere, and encourage ARMYs to adopt these positive attributes, just by staying grounded and down-to-earth.
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>why do you think what you do is important?</em>
    </p>

      <div>
        I think it’s important to have fan translators in the community because we get to share our interest and love for a group, while also making BTS’ content better accessible to more people. More so than “bridge the gap,” I’d say translators help to strengthen that bond between BTS and ARMYs.
      </div>
      <div>
        I think it’s really great that there is such a large community of translators out there, volunteering their time and efforts towards allowing fans to connect and bond internationally, both with BTS, and also among ARMYs. Each translator has their own style, and I think that’s really important and special. Though all translators are ARMYs, just like any other fan of BTS, enjoying the same contents, each offers a different interpretation of his/her own.
      </div>
      <div>
        Personally, one of the most rewarding things about translating is the fact that not only do translations allow ARMYs to better understand various contents, from lengthy, sincere messages to simple, silly little tweets that the members post, but they also foster interest in the Korean language.
      </div>
      <div>
        When possible, I try to break down a couple words, with the pronunciation and the definition of each word, under a tag I’ve started to use, #BTSvocab. Though it’s no full-length language course, there are so many accounts out there covering all aspects of immersion in the Korean culture and language, from keeping fellow ARMYs up-to-date with Korean and international news, to translations and subtitling of live video.
